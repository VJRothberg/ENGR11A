This source is helpful for looking at how GIS and gps mapping systems can help the creation of tactile maps. The article details work in Europe that utilizes symbology keys, and explains issues of customization, and being able to zoom in on specific areas. This article is a good starting point to examine aspects of creating tactile maps and what we might want to include/ learn from.

This source provides a solid framework for defining what a tactile map is and why tactile maps are necessary societal tools. It goes into the history of tactile maps, detailing when they were first created in the 1800s, and how they evolved as time went on. It debunks the suggestion that tactile maps are of no use to those who are visually impaired. It also asserts that everyone, even those with no visual impairment, should use tactile maps to enhance their understanding of the world around them.

<h3>Interviews</h3>

   <p>Conducting these interviews was a really positive experience. Everyone seemed so genuinely exicted about the projects potential and were so willing to help. Speaking with people who experience visual impairment or work with visually impaired people helped immensely to define our problem and understand what will be useful for navigation or not. We conducted these interviews with either two or three of us at a time. This approach was nice since someone could take notes, and others could ask questions. While we had a list of 8 questions to go off of, I found that the interviews ended up flowing much more naturally than going down the list, and the answers were most productive when this happened.</p>
   <h3>Brainstorming and Themes</h3>
   <img src="assets/themes.png"></img>
   <p>Since we took a bit longer to conduct our interviews we had done extensive research and brainstorming before coiming together to synthesize this information into themes. This allowed us to quickly narrow down our main points. I feel that we have a well defined problem and feasible solution at this point.</p>
   <h3>Feedback</h3>
   <p>We recieved feedback from the other teams most of which was very helpful. Unfortunately we did not have much of a prototype to showoff at this point, but we still learned from talking to others. Here is our notes on the feedback:
    Notes from presenting: 
Master map is a good idea, just anyone new to campus is helpful not just those who are visually impaired 
Are you planning to use smaller chunks or just a big map 
Entrances of academic buildings is more apparent 
How are you determining which parts are relevant 
Quantitative measurement?
Test different scales 
Inclines:
Stacks of the material?
Different texture 
Cartoon of campus not a measurement of campus

Guitar group feedback:
Likes:
3D printed ideas
Texture ideas good
Criticisms:
How to differentiate from the textures currently
Questions:
Some type of key?
How big is this gonna be?
Where are you going to place it?
Why not just have map itself everywhere and have it 3D printed? 
How are we measuring? 

Ideas:
Explain in key 
You are here labels 
Have more maps out throughout campus 
</p>
<h3> Prototyping and Testing</h3>
<p>Our initial prototype was the lower section of campus, including the theater up to Rosie quad, and from Chapels to the administartion buildings. We created an svg from a screen shot of google maps and then imported that into LightBurn. In lightburn we deleted extra buildings, cut down our area for the test, and adjusted the power/speed for lines. The triangular geometry from google maps translated into LightBurn, which we deleted by hand in our prototypes, but later solved. The first cut was far too small to feel well. The second, we widened the paths, and enlarged the whole map. Our other big change was cutting the paths out entirely for maximum contrast.</p>
